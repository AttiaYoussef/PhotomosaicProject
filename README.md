# Text to Photomosaic

This repository is associated with the work of the same name in the context of the CS-413 EPFL course "Computational Photography". 
It presents our approach to create photomosaics based on natural language input, first by creating the mosaic itself, than filling the generated mosaic with corresponding images.

## How to run

This project is meant to run on Google Colab, not only for the hardware used but also because of some installation difficulties when trying to run it locally.

The file to run is called "Photomosaic.ipynb", and to be able to run it, it has to be imported via the Google colab interface, and all associated Python files have to be imported as well in the root of the notebook.

## Images for the photomosaic part

In order to be able to run the photomosaic part, you are going to need to do some manipulations on your Google Drive account. There are two datasets of images that are shared via links, and for both these datasets, you have to add a shortcut to that folder in the root of your Google Drive.
